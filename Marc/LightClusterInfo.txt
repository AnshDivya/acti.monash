The LightCluster.csv data represents some data i have obtained from the data from the light senses
Needed for Dylan
The columns are as followed

Colour: Colour of light. White light uses lux as units, others use photons/s*m^2. Each colour while need their own seperate graph,
prefarably with a GUI that only displays one at a time, but can be flicked through using a "tab" system

Lower Bound of Range/Upper Bound of Range: These will act as the values for one of the axises. Instead of having particular points,
this data is true across a range specified by the upper and lower bounds. These bounds are in the respective light units
stated above

Spike Size: This will act as the second axis. This represents the number of counts spent asleep across one hour after being exposed
to the light. This will have values 0-60, and a correspending value for "Occurences" (see below) will be present for all these
values.

Occurences: This is the number of times across the data that "spike size" was observed under the specified light threshold.

I will need this data plotted as some kind of heat map, one for each colour. It should be range vs spike size, with occurences
as the variable colour. I'm not to concerned about the colour you chose for these heat maps, but it needs to vary enough to be
eye-catching and meaningful. The heat map may also need to be smoothed for best results


Problems:

Currently, due to the data having a lot of 3.09E+07s in it, i had to make very broad ranges. Not only does this make the map less precise,
but currently, there are actually 2 identical ranges, (the first 2, out of 5) which is VERY dangerous, as it means that the x and y
co-ordinates will have 2 values. I'm not sure how your thing will deal with this (ideally they would be averaged) but if it isn't
doing what we need it too i can do some validification first.
